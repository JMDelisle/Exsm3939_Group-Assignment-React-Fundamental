We as a group decided to do a memory game and watched a video with tutorials on how to build the game. We also have decided on how all of us are making sections of the codes to eliminate any confusion. All credit goes to The Net Ninja for his step by step on how to build a functional memory card game. We also would like to say thank you to Bo and James for assisting us during their off time. Thank you!
The game is very simple, utilizing 8 pairs of matching photos. The feature we wanted was how many turns it took you to complete the game and also how long. 

There was previously a bug in the functionality of the timer; it has since been resolved and the game timer now stops when all 8 pairs of photos have been matched.

There are several other features that we would have liked to have incorprated, but were limited due to a lack of time - much of the time we had left over was consumed by our need to get the timer working correctly because none of us wanted to accept the timer the way it was. 

Some of the features we wanted to implement included a high score or lowest time standings that would allow a user to add their name/initials to their lowest (quickest) times; a button to change the theme of the game. That is, allow the user to change the theme of the game from an auto-based theme to, say, a nature, or animal, or children's photos theme for example.
