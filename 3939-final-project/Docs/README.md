We as a group decided to do a memory game and watched a video with tutorials on how to build the game. We also have decided on how all of us are making sections of the codes to eliminate any confusion. All credit goes to The Net Ninja for his step by step on how to build a functional memory card game. We also would like to say thank you to Bo and James for assisting us during their off time. Thank you!
The game is very simple, utilizing 8 pairs of matching photos. The feature we wanted was how many turns it took you to complete the game and also how long. The current bug we have encountered is when you click on start new game, the card shuffles but the timer still keeps on ticking from the previous card game.
